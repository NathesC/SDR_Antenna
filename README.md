# SDR_Antenna

Two simple programs that will give the best 1/4 and 1/2 wave antenna size for a given frequency.
These were quickly written as part of a University of Bristol MSc Dissertation investigating reading IoT data using Software
Defined radio.


One uses command line input eg give the prog name and the frequency target eg ./antenna 433

The other will ask the user for input

I hope to come back and develop these further

compile with gcc eg

gcc antenna.c -o antenna
